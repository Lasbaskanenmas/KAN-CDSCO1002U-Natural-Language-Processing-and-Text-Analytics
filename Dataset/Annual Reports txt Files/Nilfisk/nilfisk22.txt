We entered 2022 with strong sales growth momentum that continued from our record year 2021. Additionally, in early 2022 we launched our new strategy, our 5-year Business Plan 2026 focused on value creation and long-term sustainable growth. To achieve this, we have anchored Nilfisk in a distinct customer-value proposition. We have started building growth platforms focused on carefully-selected strategic priorities and optimization opportunities. And fundamentally, we have implemented new Ways of Working as a key enabler for successful strategy execution. As a result, we achieved revenue of 1,069.5 mEUR, an increase of 7.5% from 2021 and equivalent to organic revenue growth of 4.9%. The growth was driven by our Branded Professional business, which grew 8.6% organically with all regions contributing. As in 2021, the strongest growth was achieved in our Americas region, which grew 12.5%. On the other hand, our Consumer business declined by 15.5% and our Private Label business declined by 15.7%, in line with market developments. EBITDA before special items reached 140.8 mEUR, just around 2% below the record in 2021, representing an EBITDA margin before special items of 13.2%. Our Business Plan 2026 has served us well in 2022, helping us to weather the challenges the year brought. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia fueled not only a humanitarian catastrophe but also had severe economic implications. In early March 2022, we decided to cease business in Russia, which represented around 1% of our 2021 revenue. The war also contributed to accelerating cost inflation, which central banks countered by raising interest rates. Consequently, the overall geo-political and economic climate deteriorated over the course of the year. A significant internal challenge in 2022 was caused by a tornado wiping out our US distribution center end-March 2022. Fortunately, no employees were injured. This disruptive incident caused shipment delays to our customers, non-availability of parts for months, as well as temporarily higher costs while resuming operations in a new distribution center. Even by year-end, process stability and efficiency were not yet fully restored. Nevertheless, we achieved 10% organic revenue growth in the US, which puts us well on the way in terms of delivering on our strategic priority to grow in the large-scale US market as outlined in Business Plan 2026. A great result made possible by the cross-functional collaboration and determination of our people. 2022 marked a rapidly increasing level of cost inflation unprecedented in the last 30 years. Next to cost inflation across most material categories, concerns about energy supply led to substantially higher energy costs. We countered those inflationary pressures with disciplined pricing actions. Our pricing practice and diligent implementation contributed increasingly to preserve margins over the course of the year. At the same time, global supply chain challenges and availability of critical parts continued to constrain our growth. As set out in our Business Plan 2026, we invested into enhancing supply chain robustness. Short term this led to higher levels of inventory. Longer term this is building towards reliable, cost optimized supply supporting our long-term sustainable growth targets. A core element of our strategy is to develop Service-as-a-business. We made good progress in building a dedicated service organization who will be driving this initiative. This is allowing us to gain traction in the implementation of a new business model substantially contributing to future value creation. On 25 March 2022, Peter Nilsson was elected as new Chair of the Board of Directors of Nilfisk. Peter brings a wealth of relevant business experience into the board. As CEO, Board Member or Board Chair, Peter was involved in numerous successful implementations of value creation strategies. Under his leadership, the Board of Directors have been working closely with the Nilfisk Leadership Team to ensure the successful execution of Business Plan 2026 throughout 2022. The progress in the implementation of the strategy is visible in the resilient execution of its key initiatives enabling to achieve another year of organic revenue growth while overcoming the challenges. Our sustainability commitment is an integral part of our Nilfisk value proposition and core to our strategy. Our customers are looking more and more for a reliable partner supporting them in their own sustainability targets. In 2022, we continued pushing the boundaries of our industry when it comes to sustainability. We were awarded a Gold Medal by EcoVadis, the world’s largest provider of business sustainability ratings. This makes Nilfisk part of the top 5% companies globally rated by EcoVadis. This achievement is a firm step on the way towards our ambition to lead the professional cleaning industry with sustainable products. We have been impressed again with our people in Nilfisk in 2022. Teams came together around the initiatives of Business Plan 2026. As part of our new Ways of Working multiple training sessions were held in the methodology of the Nilfisk Operating System (NOS). Organizationally, we empowered our people by allocating more decision-making authority closer to markets and business units, in order to promote agility and customer-focus. All of this was instrumental to enable our results in 2022. Our people gave an impressive demonstration of a growth mindset. Our employee survey also demonstrated the dedication of our people when we by the end of the year got an overall engagement score of 8.1, which is significantly above benchmark for our industry. We would like to thank all our employees for their great work in 2022 and for their exceptional commitment to serve our customers. We would also like to thank our customers for their continued loyalty and belief in Nilfisk. We are committed to overcome the ongoing global supply chain challenges, and we feel encouraged by your feedback in the customer value creation potential of our lifecycle services solution approach. Finally, we would like to extend a thank you to our shareholders for their continued support. We highly appreciated any feedback during 2022. Your support of Business Plan 2026 unlocks its significant value creation potential enabling long-term sustainable growth.
