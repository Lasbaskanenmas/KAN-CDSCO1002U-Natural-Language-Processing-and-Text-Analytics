Navigating challenges and delivering value. As I look back on 2024, I am filled with pride at what Salling Group has achieved. 2024 was a remarkable year for Salling Group, marked by our strong commitment to supporting our customers, colleagues, and local communities. Operating in a competitive market across Denmark, Germany, and Poland, we faced challenges such as changing consumer habits and increased regulatory requirements. Recognising the rising cost of living as a primary concern for our customers, we took decisive action. We launched several major price campaigns on essential groceries and collaborated with suppliers to lower food prices. Our focus remained on maintaining a lean, efficient organisation to deliver strong value to our customers, even in challenging economic conditions. Despite the economic pressures, our strategic initiatives and operational efficiencies have enabled us to achieve strong financial results in 2024 with a record revenue level of DKK 72.2 billion and a profit after tax of DKK 1,709 million for the year. This success underscores our ability to adapt and innovate, ensuring that we continue to meet the needs of our customers while securing a stable foundation for future growth. Our robust financial performance allows us to reinvest in our business and communities, further enhancing the value we provide to our stakeholders. In 2024, we launched our ambitious 5-year strategy, Aspire ’28, marking a pivotal moment in our corporate history. This strategy is launched a decade after buying back control from A.P. Moeller - Maersk, during which we have strengthened our financial position significantly. Our robust financial foundation enables us to dream big and set ambitious goals for the future, building on our legacy and Herman Salling’s vision. We aim to grow Salling Group by almost 40% to reach a turnover of DKK 100 billion by 2028. This growth will be driven by a focus on innovation, strategic investments in startups through our new innovation fund ‘Salling Seeds’, and transformative mergers and acquisitions. Our financial strength allows us to invest confidently in these areas, ensuring that we can seize opportunities and navigate challenges effectively. With Aspire ‘28 we will increase the robustness of our company and ensure we have multiple strong legs. Central to Aspire ‘28 are our corporate priorities (the 5Ks): Kunder (Customers), Kolleger (Colleagues), Kønsdiversitet (Gender Diversity), Kultur (Culture), and Klima (Climate). These priorities guide us in enhancing customer experiences, fostering an inclusive work environment, and committing to sustainability. By aligning our strategy with these core priorities, we ensure that Salling Group remains a leader in the retail industry. Aspire ‘28 is not just about growth; it’s about building a future where we create long-term value for our stakeholders and contribute positively to society. 2024 was also a year of significant milestones aimed at enhancing customer experience. We completed the conversion of all Danish Netto stores to our 3.0 concept, offering a modern and inspiring shopping experience. We invested in Bilka stores, focusing on diverse product categories, and launched a new strategy in føtex to promote customer health. In Poland, we expanded our store network and tested our first 4.0 format, while in Germany, we continued to invest in providing the best shopping experience. As we set new ambitions, we also embarked on a journey to evolve our culture. We have named this initiative Horizon. Our strong culture, characterised by passion, integrity, and decisive execution, is something we are immensely proud of. In 2024, we conducted extensive data collection to understand our current identity and used this knowledge to shape our aspirations. We aim to enhance our strengths and embrace new traits that will help us achieve our dreams. Sustainability remains a strategic priority. In 2024, we reached a significant milestone with the launch of our “MadPlus” initiative, focusing on reducing food waste across our Danish stores. This initiative underscores our commitment to tackling food waste as a central agenda. We are working tirelessly to decrease waste in our daily operations across the group, recognising that reducing food waste is not only about conserving resources but also has important economic implications for our business. In addition to our efforts in food waste, we are making progress in reducing our climate footprint. This complex agenda requires substantial effort from and collaboration with our suppliers, as 95% of our climate impact lies outside our own operations. We have set ambitious goals for our suppliers to establish science-based climate targets, and I will strongly encourage all of our suppliers to get engaged on the climate agenda and start by setting climate targets. Beyond our organisational investments, we formed a historic partnership with the Danish Football Association (DBU) - the biggest partnership in history for both organisations. This collaboration spans national teams and local clubs, focusing on promoting equality, equal opportunities, physical and mental health, well-being, recruitment, and education. I look forward to leverage the benefits of this partnership. Salling Group is on a transformative journey, and I am especially proud that our continuous efforts were recognised by the public in the annual Danish IFO Image Survey. For the first time ever, Salling Group ranked in top ten, moving up 12 spots from last year. As we enter 2025, we are confronted with geopolitical, economic, and regulatory uncertainties that are likely to impact consumer behaviour, disrupt supply chains, and influence our business operations. As a pivotal step in our new strategy, we embarked on an exciting journey in March 2025 by agreeing to acquire the Baltic retailer Rimi Baltic from the Swedish retailer ICA Gruppen. This acquisition, which includes 314 stores, a strong e-commerce platform, and over 11,000 employees, is a key step in strengthening our market position and enhancing our resilience. We await regulatory approval of the acquisition and look forward to welcoming Rimi into the Salling Group family, marking our first entry into the Baltic market. I extend my deepest thanks to my colleagues across offices, stores, and distribution centres for their exceptional efforts in 2024. I am proud to work with such a dedicated team, committed to providing our customers with an inspiring shopping experience every day. Dear Stakeholders, congratulations to all of you for another very good year for Salling Group. In a very difficult and volatile year we delivered great financial results once again. Revenue growth of 2.7% to DKK 72.2 billion, an EBIT improvement of DKK 272 million to DKK 2.7 billion and mostly impressive a Net Cashflow from operations of DKK 4.2 billion underline the excellent work of our management and all our employees. Not only did we deliver these short-term results, but management also worked very thoroughly on the mid-term plan and finalised our 5-year strategy – Aspire ‘28. This plan has the ambition to grow and for Salling Group to be a DKK 100 billion company in 2028. This is of course very ambitious, but our strong leadership, our long-term focus, our great workforce, and our owner structure allows us to think big. Not only did management build the plan, but we also already executed on it in the beginning of 2025 by acquiring the Rimi chain in the Baltics. A great chain with 314 stores in 3 countries (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) and DKK 15 billion in revenue will now be part of our group. Rimi is a very strong and successful concept with strong local leadership and I am very excited to have them as part of our group. Another part of the plan is to focus on innovation and strategic investments through the new innovation fund ‘Salling Seeds’. Our financial strength allows us to look for startups and innovative projects and invest in them to create long-term value and also to invest in projects that would improve our core business. In the core of our business is of course still Netto, Bilka, føtex, and Salling in Denmark, and Netto in Germany and Poland. Here we will continue to focus on being the best we can for our customers. I have seen improvements in all these areas in 2024 and I am convinced that this will continue in 2025. The commitment to our 5Ks (Kunder, Kollegaer, Kønsdiversitet, Kultur, and Klima) is 100% right and we will of course continue to focus on this. These 5Ks will always be the leading principles for all our current and future businesses. We in the Board of Directors are very impressed by the work Anders and his leadership team are doing and we are also very happy with the communication and dialogue we have. Salling Group is a very strong company with great ownership and with a commitment to long-term growth. We in the Board are all proud to be part of it.
