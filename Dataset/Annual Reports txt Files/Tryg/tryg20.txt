All financial targets met In 2020, Tryg met all the financial targets presented at the Capital Markets Day (CMD) in November 2017. The technical result target of DKK 3,300bn should be seen against a full-year technical result of DKK 3,495bn, the combined ratio target of ≤ 86 should be seen against a full-year combined ratio of 84.5, and the expense ratio target of ~14 should be seen against a full-year expense ratio of 14.1. In a stock exchange announcement on March 27, Tryg abandoned the ≥ 21% after tax ROE target for 2020 following unprecedented capital market developments in Q1. The mark-to-market losses in Q1 were more than fully recovered in the following quarters, and Tryg is reporting a FY ROE of 22.5%. Achieving targets through strategic initiatives Tryg has defined four strategic initiatives to achieve its financial targets, including continuous work on claims excellence through leveraging of Tryg's procurement power and capitalising on Alka’s fraud capabilities. Many customers prefer digital communication, and Tryg aims to offer a wide range of digital self-service solutions, including solutions that enable customers to access exactly which products and coverage they need, buy insurance products, make changes to existing products and to report claims. In 2020, more than 5 million customers logged in to Tryg’s digital self-service offerings. Tryg continued to focus on distribution efficiency, and in 2020 the continued use of agents was the primary driver of benefits. Private in Denmark and Norway as well as Commercial in Denmark have been particularly successful in using agents. Tryg is constantly developing new products and services, which has resulted in the launch of more than 50 new products and services since the beginning of 2018. These products and services meet customer demand and are increasing Tryg's share of wallet. Strong customer focus Tryg continues to have a strong customer focus. In 2020, the Transaction Net Promotor Score (TNPS) was 72, exceeding the ambitious target of 70. The number of products per customer was 3.9 in 2020, corresponding to growth of 7% per customer, and therefore slightly lower than the targeted 4.0. This is mainly due to strong growth in the car sales channel in Norway selling only motor insurance. High profitable growth driven by Private segment Tryg reported a premium growth of 7.0%, driven by strong growth of 9.0% in the profitable Private segment in both Denmark and Norway. The Commercial segment also reported a positive growth of 6.0%, supported by both Denmark and Norway. Corporate reported a growth of 1.4%, reflecting a continued focus on improving profitability in all countries. The development in 2020 supports the focus to rebalance the portfolio with more Private and Commercial business and less Corporate business. Stable and increasing dividend to shareholders Tryg has a strong focus on ensuring that shareholders receive a nominal and stable increase in dividends. A total dividend of DKK 7.00 per share will be paid for 2020 (DKK 6.80 in 2019). After the significant negative impact of COVID-19 in Q1 2020, Tryg announced an annual dividend decision instead of quarterly dividend payment. However, despite challenging times, Tryg's business model proved very resilient, and it was therefore decided on 9 November 2020 to pay out a dividend of DKK 5.25 per share for the first three quarters of 2020. In Q4, Tryg will pay a dividend per share of DKK 1.75. Recommended cash offer for RSA Insurance Group Plc On 18 November, Tryg made a recommended cash offer together with the Canadian insurer Intact Financial Corporation to acquire RSA Insurance Group Plc. As part of the transaction, Tryg will take over RSA's Swedish and Norwegian businesses and co-own RSA’s Danish business on a 50/50 economic basis. The acquisition will make Tryg the biggest non-life insurer in Scandinavia and create a much more balanced group with a significantly strengthened presence in Sweden. The acquisition is expected to achieve an ROI of around 7%, result in the high teen EPS accretion by 2023 and double the technical result (including DKK 900m of synergies) in 2024. Tryg takes confidence from the Alka acquisition, which delivered synergies of DKK 176m in 2020 against a target of DKK 150m. A year with COVID-19 COVID-19 impacted 2020 in many ways. Primarily, it led to changed ways of working for all employees with much more working from home and virtual meetings. Despite this big change, Tryg managed to improve customer satisfaction and maintain high sales level due to very flexible employees and strong customer focus. The financial impact of COVID-19 was limited in 2020 with a large loss driven by travel insurance claims in Q1 2020 fully offset by lower claims frequencies in the following quarters. Thanks to all employees 2020 was a very challenging year for all the employees in Tryg as a result of COVID-19. We are very proud to see how the employees adapted to a new and unprecedented situation with a continued strong customer focus. Furthermore, even in this difficult situation we saw that job satisfaction increased to 80 in 2020 against 78 in 2019. The Supervisory Board and the Executive Board would like to thank all employees for their great efforts
