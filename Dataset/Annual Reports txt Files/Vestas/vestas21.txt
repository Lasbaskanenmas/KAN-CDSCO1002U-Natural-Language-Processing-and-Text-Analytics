As such, we are on the brink of a sustainable era where we will see unprecedented change across all areas of society. Transportation, heating, and cooling will soon be electrified, and the shift to renewables will create a strong drive to integrate sustainability in everything we do. The journey ahead will not be a straight line and emissions will most likely increase again in 2021, but 2020 has shown that the solutions are ready. During the year, our supply chain and partners spent substantial time planning mutual steps to decarbonise the world’s most sustainable assets – wind turbines – even further. At the end of 2020, our 129 GW of installed wind turbines saves the world 186 million tonnes of CO2 annually, and during the year we reduced our own carbon emissions with 33 percent, illustrating that we together with our suppliers and partners can do this with even greater momentum and speed. However, we would not be where we are today, and Vestas would not be playing the key role it is playing in creating a sustainable planet for our children and grandchildren, were it not for our employees. During an exceptionally challenging year, everyone at Vestas demon- strated incredible passion and purpose, and made individual and team sacrifices, to ensure we kept our promises and helped to accelerate the deployment of renewables for our customers and societies. On behalf of the Board of Directors and Executive Manage- ment, we want to thank all Vestas colleagues across the globe for their efforts in 2020. To this end and despite being outside the earnings guidance announced in February, eligibl e Vestas employees will receive an extraordinary reward totaling EUR 25m for ensuring business continuity and driving the global activities forward through this unprec- edented year. The decision was made by the Board on recommendation from Nomination & Compensation Committee, and excludes Executive Management because we didn’t meet our performance KPIs. This special rec- ognition reflects the tremendous contribution from team Vestas in 2020 and that COVID- 19 will impact our business well into 2021. In the future, 2020 will be remembered as the year of COVID-19, but for Vestas it was also the year where we set the direction for the next decade. Together with our 29,000 colleagues, we have an even stronger intent in 2021 to create a more sustainable planet and bring us closer to our vision of being the global leader in sustainable energy solutions.
