"We were also extremely pleased to present the first clinical data for DuoBody-PD-L1x4-1BB, one of our programs in development with BioNTech, at the Society for Immunotherapy of CancerÕs (SITC) 35th Anniversary Annual Meeting.",neutral
"In addition to the development of our own pipeline, there were great leaps forward with antibodies created by Genmab that are now being developed and marketed by other companies.",neutral
"Chief among these is DARZALEX¨ (daratumumab), developed and commercialized by Janssen.",neutral
"DARZALEX¨ has already revolutionized the treatment of multiple myeloma, and in 2020 it became the first and only subcutaneously administered CD38 antibody approved in the world.",neutral

"Genmab continues to closely monitor developments related to the pandemic and follows recommendations from various authorities, including governments and global and local health agencies.",neutral
"Genmab established a COVID-19 response team, which I lead, that closely monitors the evolving situation, develops and implements precautionary measures to help limit the impact of COVID-19 at our workplace and on our communities and ensures business continuity.",neutral
"Genmab is actively monitoring the potential impact on our key priorities and assessing the situation on an ongoing basis in close contact with clinical trial sites, physicians and contract research organizations (CROs) to evaluate the impact and challenges posed by the COVID-19 situation and manage them accordingly.",neutral
"I believe that 2020 was a turning point for Genmab, with events that turbocharged our evolution into a fully integrated biotech innovation powerhouse.",neutral
"This evolution will allow us to deliver on our commitment to patients and shareholders not only through successful partnered products, but with our own products that may revolutionize cancer treatment.",positive

We wish him all the best for his new adventure and I am sure we will continue to see him from time to time.,neutral
"Once a Salling Group family member, always a Salling Group family member.",neutral
We were very proud to have a successor in our own ranks.,neutral
Anders Hagh took over the CEO role on 1 July 2023 and has since then also done an excellent job.,neutral
Anders served as our CFO for 8 years and has been very instrumental in our GroupÕs success.,neutral
Ever since Anders took over the CEO role he has been very visible and hands on in the organisation.,neutral
"He has worked very hard on both the short-term operational issues, but also started the work on the long-term strategy for our company.",neutral
Short-term we need to continue to improve our business in all our formats in Denmark.,neutral

"We will continue to invest in our formats, our people and our infrastructure and always with sustainability in mind.",neutral
"On behalf of the Supervisory Board, I wish you all a healthy, successful and fun 2024.",positive
2022 marked the end of our financial turnaround and we entered a new chapter of the OneISS strategy execution.,neutral
"With a completed divestment programme, continued financial progress and a solid commercial momentum, ISS is ready to deliver on the ambitious financial targets for the coming years.",positive
This will be built on our strengthened operational excellence and our ambitions to champion sustainable workplaces in partnership with our customers and placemakers.,neutral
"As the world gradually emerged from the global Covid-19 pandemic, 2022 provided the global workplace with new and profound challenges.",neutral
"The devastating war in Ukraine, strained supply chains and soaring inflation were just a few of many issues that business leaders around the world had to address.",negative
"In addition, new hybrid ways of working required many companies to rethink and redesign their physical workplaces.",neutral
"For ISS, this bolstered global demand for integrated workplace and facility services and sharpened the focus further on delivering on our purpose of connecting people and places to make the world work better.",neutral
"Looking back at 2022, we can proudly say that once again our more than 350,000 placemakers have gone above and beyond in providing outstanding services to our customers.",neutral
We thank each and every one of our colleagues for their dedicated support and persistence.,neutral
"While we have supported our customers in the global workplace, we have also taken a huge step forward on our own OneISS strategy execution.",neutral
"By completing the financial turnaround that we embarked on in late 2020, we are now ready to move into the next phase of our strategy execution and have laid out a solid foundation for future growth at sustainable and attractive margins.",positive
"Commercial momentum and organic growth Throughout the year, we have seen good commercial momentum Ð both with existing and new customers.",positive
"Together with all the initiatives from our financial turnaround and strategic execution, this has resulted in improved financial performance.",positive
"Activity and revenue increased to above pre-Covid levels on all service lines, except within food services.",neutral
Our organic growth was 7.8% compared to 2.0% in 2021.,positive
"The increase was mainly driven by the continued strong return-to-office trends, scope increases as customers increased investments in upgrading workplaces and service offerings, and price increases implemented across the group to offset the higher cost inflation.",positive
Operating margin before other items was 3.8% (excluding the impact of hyperinflation) for 2022 (2021: 2.5%).,neutral
The development was driven by the improvement of the underperforming countries and contracts.,neutral
"In 2022, realised cost inflation was higher than seen in many years.",negative
"ISS has well-embedded processes in place, and inflation was managed tightly through price increases and operational efficiencies.",negative
"As a result, the operating margin was generally unaffected by inflation.",negative
"Generally, our commercial momentum benefitted from our strategic focus and initiatives, and we succeeded in extending all global key account contracts up for renewal.",positive
"We also extended and expanded several key account contracts and as a result, customer retention for 2022 was historical high reaching 94%, when excluding the planned exit of the Danish Defence contract.",neutral
"Delivering on our financial turnaround Since December 2020, we have focused on two areas; delivering the financial turnaround while at the same time investing in our operating model to become a differentiated global leader within Integrated Facility Services and maintaining our position as global number one in cleaning.",neutral
"During 2022, we could officially mark the financial turnaround as completed.",neutral
"All turnaround targets were achieved, as the operating run-rate margin at the end of 2022 was above 4%, while the net debt was reduced to below 3x pro-forma adjusted EBITDA (LTM).",positive
"Furthermore, we completed the strategic divestment programme which as expected yielded net proceeds of approximately DKK 2 billion.",positive
"With the enhanced operating model and healthy financial foundation in place, we can now turn to the next phase of our OneISS strategy.",neutral
"Unfolding the OneISS strategy At our Capital Markets Day in November 2022, we presented new financial targets and updated capital allocation principles, as well as how we will unfold the full potential of the OneISS strategy.",neutral
"The growth agenda will be focused on providing Integrated Facility Services to key accounts in three segments (office-based, production-based and healthcare) from a stronghold as global leader in cleaning.",positive
"To support this, we have identified three key areas in which we will invest further: operational efficiency, technology and sustainability.",neutral
These areas will become differentiating factors for performance at our customersÕ workplaces and will drive stronger commercial momentum.,positive
"Operational efficiency is delivered through our enhanced operating model, which is enabling the launch of a portfolio of scalable service products to drive a step-change in global productivity.",positive
The investments in technology are focused on creating an ecosystem of scalable platforms with data and innovation.,neutral
The first key applications are already launched for customers and placemakers to improve the service across workplaces globally.,neutral
"Through our newly established dedicated software development centre in Porto alongside our Warsaw hub, we can develop differentiating high-quality and scalable digital solutions for both the ISS enterprise and customers globally.",neutral
"Finally, ISS is determined to become the sustainability leader in the industry.",neutral
"Championing sustainable workplaces ISS is a people company and throughout our history, we have always wanted to contribute positively to the societies we are part of.",neutral
"In 2022, we strengthened our sustainability efforts further.",neutral
"We launched the ambition of championing sustainable workplaces, driving true change through both social and environmental sustainability.",neutral
The dual focus ensures that we can continue to strengthen our competitiveness and support growth in the next phase of our strategy execution.,positive
"During 2022, we progressed significantly on our ambitious sustainability journey.",neutral
Both within our own enterprise and in the way we support our customers in achieving their sustainability efforts.,neutral
"Within environmental sustainability, we announced our commitment to reach full-scope net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.",neutral
This was followed by several supporting initiatives throughout the year.,neutral
"Among other things, ISS signed the Cool Food Pledge, committing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the food we serve globally by 25 percent by 2030, and halve our food waste by 2027.",neutral
"We also committed to reach our fleet net zero target by 2030 using electrification of our fleet of 20,000+ vehicles as a key lever.",neutral
"The Company of Belonging Within social sustainability, we launched a new Employee Value Proposition (EVP), developed our Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging agenda further and introduced an ambition to become the Company of Belonging.",neutral
Shaping the right culture and creating a safe and inclusive environment is not only important from a social sustainability point of view.,neutral
It is absolutely crucial in order to deliver on our strategy and our purpose.,neutral
That was the main reason behind launching our new ambition of becoming the Company of Belonging during the autumn of 2022.,neutral
"Through building an environment where every employee feels accepted, empowered and can thrive as their authentic selves, we will create better experiences and more sustainable outcomes for our placemakers, customers, partners and their communities.",neutral
"The ambition is backed by three signature objectives focusing on living wages, upskilling and recognition.",neutral
"Together, they are a purposeful and intentional promise that will accelerate our journey towards becoming the Company of Belonging.",neutral
"To underpin our commitment to our placemakers, we also launched a new global employee promise and value proposition (EVP): A Place To Be You.",neutral
It enables us to live up to our promise that every one of our placemakers can achieve their full potential as their authentic selves in an inclusive environment.,neutral
"Building on our achievements Having delivered on the turnaround initiatives and our strategic ambitions in the past couple of years, ISS is now poised to enter the next phase of our OneISS strategy.",positive

"We will do so while also adding value to all our stakeholders, not least our 350,000+ placemakers and the customers they serve every day.",neutral
That is our promise and commitment.,neutral
Continued leadership in a tough year.,neutral
"When looking back on a year just passed, it is usually wise to wait some time before making definitive statements about how that year will be remembered; about how its events will impact the years and decades ahead.",neutral
"Some events feel groundbreaking as they unfold, but end up having only minimal long-term impact.",neutral
Other events go almost unnoticed in the moment but can change the way we live our lives in the future.,neutral
"However, it is already safe to say that 2020 was totally unprece- dented and everything that took place during the year will be remembered in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",neutral
"For the energy industry, 2020 was without question the year of COVID-19.",neutral
The pandemic affected every part of the value chain and forced everyone to be even more resilient and innovative to ensure stable energy systems across the globe.,neutral
"In a year when COVID-19 dominated the agenda and challenged mobil- ity as well as safety, the renewable energy industryÕs ability to ensure continuity and sta- bility was potentially game-changing.",neutral
"It may have gone a little unnoticed, but we believe the contribution made by renewables during the crisis will have huge implications for the future.",negative
"When the stakes were highest, we showed resilience and proved we can serve as the backbone of energy systems around the world.",positive
"This achievement is significant because the climate crisis remains the biggest challenge the world has ever faced, and questions have been raised about whether renewables are ready to replace fossil fuels to limit CO2 emis- sions.",positive
"To this end, one positive to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic was the clear evi- dence that renewables can provide the foun- dations for more resilient societies, offering clean, stable, and cost-competitive energy, as well as sustaining and creating jobs.",positive
"As a tes- tament to this, governments across the globe, including in the USA, EU, China, and Japan, developed green recovery plans or intentions to do so in 2021.",neutral
"In this respect, we believe the world turned a corner in 2020, paving the way for a more sustainable planet.",neutral
"At Vestas, we are proud that we continued to play a key role in the fight against climate change in 2020, and underlined our leader- ship by achieving market-leading revenue, scale, technology, order intake, and profitabil- ity.",neutral
"During the year, we consolidated our lead- ership position and took strategic steps to expand our presence across the value chain.",positive
"We also had to face unfamiliar challenges, such as living up to the quality provisions expected of Vestas.",neutral
"Nonetheless, every one of our employees did an extraordinary job in making sure our installed base of more than 75,000 turbines delivered sustainable energy across the globe.",positive
"Early in the year, we concluded that by lever- aging our strong safety culture and establish- ing clear governance around our COVID-19 crisis management, we could combine safety and business continuity during the pandemic.",positive
"Today, we know that the simplicity and direc- tional nature of this decision helped create a united team at Vestas, enabling us to find solutions to the challenges and complexities we faced.",neutral
"For this and much more, we owe all our 29,000 colleagues a heartfelt thank you.",neutral
Expanding and delivering on our core to grasp future growth.,positive
"Onshore and offshore wind and service remain the core of our business, creating opportunities for us to grow and expand our reach into new areas of renewables and the energy transition.",neutral
We are therefore pleased that in 2020 we achieved several important milestones and executed on strategic initi- atives that will shape VestasÕ evolution over the next decade.,positive
"Among the most important milestones, in 2020 we managed to scale our business to meet demand, increasing revenue to EUR 14.8bn, representing 22 percent growth compared to 2019 and 46 percent compared to 2018.",positive
"We also became the first company with 100 GW of wind turbines under service, underlining the key role our Service business will play in terms of future revenue and cash flow.",neutral
"At the same time, we took huge steps forward in sustainability, including efforts to electrify our service vehicles and benefit cars.",positive
"We also optimised our product portfolio by introducing new localised vari- ants, installing the first EnVentusTM turbines, and made the tough decision to discontinue product development that didnÕt provide suf- ficient returns.",neutral
"In 2020, we continued to progress and execute on our strategic priorities for the mid- and long-term to remain the industry leader towards 2030.",positive
"Most prominently, this process included strengthening our partner- ship with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI).",neutral
"and acquiring all shares in the joint venture, MHI Vestas Offshore Wind.",neutral
"Through these developments, we made an emphatic move within offshore that will help accelerate the deployment of large-scale renewables and take us closer to our vision as the global leader in sustainable energy solutions.",neutral
"We therefore want to thank our close partner in MHI for collaborating with us since 2014, and for sharing the vision to create a more sustainable future.",neutral
"We are also delighted that Kentaro Hosomi, President & CEO of MHI Energy Systems, will be nominated to joining our Board from April 2021.",neutral
"In recent years, Vestas has also increased its presence in the development of renewable energy projects and built a strong global development pipeline.",positive
"As a result, in 2020 we established a Development business unit which, in close collaboration with the rest of the company, will create a new revenue stream to the benefit of our global customers, local communities, and shareholders.",positive
"In close alignment with our development activities, Vestas also acquired a 25 percent stake in Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, the worldÕs largest dedicated fund manager in greenfield renewable energy infrastructure.",neutral
"Through this acquisition we aim to build another pathway to value creation, accessing the long-term returns generated by renewa- ble energy projects.",neutral
We also aim to go beyond our Development businessÕ current focus of co-development and early-stage investment in renewables projects.,neutral
"Since 2018, we have grown revenue by 46 percent, but in that period our profitability and quality have not followed the same posi- tive trajectory.",neutral
"Although COVID-19 increased executional cost, in early 2020 we made the decision to decline financial support from governments, as this allows us to manage our operations and capital structure in both the short and long term.",negative
The key to improving our profitability is through our own execution.,neutral
"and discipline and looking ahead, we aim to increase the gross margin on our projects
and reduce the costs associated with quality issues.",positive
"Indeed, any shortfall in quality can impact our profitability; for example, in the second quarter of 2020 we made the extraor- dinary warranty provisions of EUR 175m to repair and upgrade turbine blades.",neutral
"A key strategic focus area is therefore to ensure our quality across the value chain lives up to customer expectations, and is befitting of our heritage as the industry leader.",positive
"Our work to become the safest company in the energy industry continued in 2020, although COVID-19 meant the introduction of new policies and guidelines to keep our global workforce safe.",neutral
"Throughout the year, everyone at Vestas acted diligently to keep the COVID- impact at a minimum, underscoring how we take care of each other and continually evolve our safety culture.",neutral
The close collaboration between our Board of Directors and Executive Management is key to ensuring a clear direction for everyone at Vestas.,neutral
"Through a well-established process, with a yearly strategy seminar and frequent operational follow-ups, the Board of Directors and Executive Management continuously inter- act to ensure alignment on major priorities.",neutral
"Through this collaboration, the Board of Directors and Executive Management has set out the future direction for Vestas as outlined in our strategy.",neutral
"Concretely, this means that VestasÕ focus on the climate crisis translates into addressing three key challenges.",negative
"These challenges, which offer huge business oppor- tunities and which Vestas has the capabilities to solve, are: Accelerate the deployment of renewable energy, Drive society-wide electrification, and Implement solutions for non-electrifiable use.",neutral
VestasÕ vision and strategy address these challenges by setting strategic priorities and defining the best executional sequence.,positive
We see this as a very directional way of enabling the whole organisation to engage in our vision: to be the global leader of sustainable energy solutions.,neutral
These priorities will require the integration of our onshore and offshore businesses into one efficient and winning operating model in 2021.,neutral
"Following meticulous planning since the announcement of the strengthened part- nership with MHI in October 2020, we are well underway with this project, but we remain realistic about the effort required to create a unified culture focused on accelerating the energy transition.",neutral
"We want to build an organi- sation that will become a leader in offshore by 2025, which means we need to catch up fast and successfully introduce our new offshore platform by this Annual Report 2020 release: the V236-15.0 MWTM.",neutral
"We also continue to invest in sustaining our technology leadership through modularisa- tion, and through nurturing talent, diversity, and leadership while strengthening our customer focus.",neutral
"To support this development and ensure we have the right capabilities in Executive Management, we were excited to welcome Tommy Rahbek Nielsen as Chief Operating Officer and Anders Nielsen as Chief Technology Officer in May 2020.",neutral
"Anders Nielsen replaced Anders Vedel, who contin- ues as Chief Scientific Advisor and whom we would like to thank for his ongoing service to wind energy and Vestas.",neutral
On the brink of a new sustainable era.,neutral
2020 was a remarkable year that pushed the world into its worst crisis in more than a lifetime.,negative
"At the same time, 2020 was also the year in which the worldÕs CO2 emissions decreased more than ever before and where renewable energy showed it is ready to become the dominant energy source.",neutral
"As such, we are on the brink of a sustainable era where we will see unprecedented change across all areas of society.",neutral
"Transportation, heating, and cooling will soon be electrified, and the shift to renewables will create a strong drive to integrate sustainability in everything we do.",positive
"The journey ahead will not be a straight line and emissions will most likely increase again in 2021, but 2020 has shown that the solutions are ready.",positive
"During the year, our supply chain and partners spent substantial time planning mutual steps to decarbonise the worldÕs most sustainable assets Ð wind turbines Ð even further.",neutral
"At the end of 2020, our 129 GW of installed wind turbines saves the world 186 million tonnes of CO2 annually, and during the year we reduced our own carbon emissions with 33 percent, illustrating that we together with our suppliers and partners can do this with even greater momentum and speed.",positive
"However, we would not be where we are today, and Vestas would not be playing the key role it is playing in creating a sustainable planet for our children and grandchildren, were it not for our employees.",neutral
"During an exceptionally challenging year, everyone at Vestas demon- strated incredible passion and purpose, and made individual and team sacrifices, to ensure we kept our promises and helped to accelerate the deployment of renewables for our customers and societies.",negative
"On behalf of the Board of Directors and Executive Manage- ment, we want to thank all Vestas colleagues across the globe for their efforts in 2020.",neutral
"To this end and despite being outside the earnings guidance announced in February, eligibl e Vestas employees will receive an extraordinary reward totaling EUR 25m for ensuring business continuity and driving the global activities forward through this unprec- edented year.",neutral
"The decision was made by the Board on recommendation from Nomination & Compensation Committee, and excludes Executive Management because we didnÕt meet our performance KPIs.",neutral
This special rec- ognition reflects the tremendous contribution from team Vestas in 2020 and that COVID- 19 will impact our business well into 2021.,neutral
"In the future, 2020 will be remembered as the year of COVID-19, but for Vestas it was also the year where we set the direction for the next decade.",neutral
"Together with our 29,000 colleagues, we have an even stronger intent in 2021 to create a more sustainable planet and bring us closer to our vision of being the global leader in sustainable energy solutions.",neutral
Thank you to every external and internal stakeholder for your support and commitment in 2020.,neutral
"ISS delivered significant strategic, financial, and operational progress in 2021.",positive
"Thanks to our more than 350,000 placemakers, and despite substantial headwinds, not least from the Covid-19 pandemic, ISS supported the needs of our customers as the global workplace was undergoing rapid change.",neutral
"Furthermore, we strengthened our efforts substantially towards a full-scope net zero business by 2040.",neutral
"Led by our purpose of connecting people and places to make the world work better, we have focused on providing a clean and safe working environment for our customersÕ employees as well as our own employees Ð who we call placemakers.",neutral
This remained a top priority to keep vital infrastructure and key production facilities open and operational in a year where the pandemic was yet again a dominating factor.,neutral
"At the same time, we supported a rapidly-changing global workplace with hybrid work becoming the new normal at many of our office-based customers.",neutral
We want to thank all our employees for working tirelessly in ensuring this vital support to our customers.,neutral
2021 was another difficult year for the world as the Covid-19 pandemic continued to challenge societies and businesses.,neutral
"As a leading provider of services to the global workplace, this also affected ISS.",neutral
"The adverse impact on our revenue from Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns continued to vary across our services, customer segments and geographies.",neutral
"However, we also saw a positive contribution from continued strong demand for deep-cleaning and disinfection solutions, which supported our revenue related to project work.",positive
"Solid financial developments Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and a volatile business environment with wage inflation and labour shortages in many regions, ISS remained resilient and delivered significant financial and operational progress in 2021.",positive
This was not least due to the impact from our turnaround programme and restructuring initiatives across our business and a strong focus on servicing our key customer segments.,positive
"Organic growth was 2.0% in 2021, compared with (6.6)% in 2020, mainly due to improvements in the portfolio revenue despite continued subdued activity across many segments and regions.",positive
"Growth remains a key focus area for us, and with the OneISS strategy we are investing further to develop our commercial processes and in delivering world-class customer solutions to attract and retain customers.",positive
Our execution of the turnaround programme and restructuring initiatives and the implementation of the OneISS strategy led to a significant improvement of our operating margin as well as strong cash flow generation.,positive
"As a result, we raised our financial guidance in the second half of 2021 and ended the full year with an operating margin of 2.5% and a free cash flow of DKK 1.7 billion, in line with our revised guidance.",positive
"Delivering on our strategic ambitions The financial progress was a testament to our persistent focus on implementing the OneISS strategy, which sets out our dual priority of delivering a short-term turnaround while at the same time ensuring long-term improvements to the global operating model.",positive
"We launched our strategy refresh in December 2020 with the clear aim of sharpening our focus on key segments, accelerating technology investments, and introducing a new globally aligned operating model.",neutral

All to ensure that ISS is fit for the future and that we can fulfil our strategic ambitions by delivering strong outcomes for all stakeholders.,positive
"As a result, 40% of our top 400 leaders are new to their roles.",neutral
"Furthermore, we have significantly strengthened the Executive Group Management team with a good combination of executives recruited within ISSÕs own talent pool and external profiles with the right international expertise and experience.",neutral
Turnaround initiatives on track We continued to execute on our turnaround programme for 2021Ð2022 focusing on profitability and cash generation.,neutral
"The turnaround plan entails a substantial improvement of underperforming contracts and countries, a recovery from the Covid-19 situation and a sharpened strategic focus through our divestment programme.",positive
"During the year, we achieved important milestones on these priorities.",positive
"In June, we reached an agreement to gradually exit the underperforming partnership contract with Danish Defence.",neutral
"Furthermore, the performance of the Deutsche Telekom contract, our largest contract globally, developed according to the recovery plan and we saw improvements in the performance of our operations in France and the UK.",neutral
"On our divestment programme, we signed or completed a total of 14 divestments during the year (including in January 2022), taking us well ahead of our plan and securing net proceeds of DKK 1.8 billion out of the targeted DKK 2 billion by year-end 2022.",neutral
"In addition, we saw the early signs of recovery from the pandemic as customers gradually returned to offices in certain countries and despite the recent rise in infection rates.",neutral
"Overall, we delivered according to plan on the turnaround programme, and in some areas even ahead of our expectations.",positive

OneISS is all about truly leveraging the power of being a large global enterprise and with that constantly providing the best of ISS to our customers.,neutral
"By doing so, we raise the efficiency, quality, and consistency of our operational performance.",neutral
One example was the introduction of sophisticated benchmarking tools for enhanced productivity of daily office cleaning in selected countries and contracts.,neutral
The tool allows operators and specialists to identify improvement potential at customer sites as well as the required actions to achieve it.,neutral

Last year we delivered a record revenue of DKK 60.9 bn with an EBIT of 2.8 bn and a ROIC of 14.3%.,positive
I would like to start out by extending a sincere thank you to our teams out in stores and in warehouses who worked through very challenging conditions during 2020.,negative

This has impressed me greatly and I am happy to report that absence rates remained low during 2020 with only few of our colleagues being infected with COVID-19.,neutral
Looking back at 2020 I am particularly pleased with the fact that we managed to decide on a number of important strategic priorities that will shape the Group for the future.,positive

Both leaders have substantial prior experience in successfully executing performance improvement programs.,neutral
This new Nilfisk leadership team is committed to improving underlying performance and generating the organic growth needed to become the recognized leader in the professional cleaning equipment industry.,positive
"During the second half of 2021, the Nilfisk Leadership Team conducted a rigorous strategy review to decide on future strategic priorities.",positive
"The process helped to identify untapped profitable growth opportunities, but also to reflect upon past execution shortcomings.",positive
The conclusions of the strategy review have been captured in a solid five-year business plan focused on enabling long-term sustainable growth as well as detailing the roadmap for successful implementation.,positive
"At the same time, Nilfisk believes it is our fundamental responsibility to lead the way on environmental, social, and governance related matters (ESG).",neutral

The year 2021 also saw Nilfisk display its technological skills.,neutral
"With our first large-scale rollout of a fleet of autonomous cleaning machines to a leading European retailer, we went beyond proof of concept and demonstrated that we mastered the technology and its software-related services.",neutral
Overall sales growth in 2021 was constrained by the global supply chain challenges affecting many companies.,positive
Our reaction to these supply chain challenges was twofold.,neutral
"First, we increased production volume by ramping up internal capacity, broadening our supplier network, and expanding our inventory of material and components.",neutral
"Second, we announced an extraordinary mid-year price increase to mitigate the margin impact of the jump in material and freight costs.",positive
"Order intake in the year far surpassed sales growth, so we ended 2021 with a record order backlog.",positive
Ensuring our ability to deliver continued growth and profitability by mitigating supply chain constraints and their margin implications remains our top short-term priority moving into 2022.,positive
The COVID pandemic created increased awareness of the value of clean among our customers.,neutral

This comes on top of the fundamental growth drivers of the global professional cleaning equipment industry.,positive
"Despite the strong recovery in 2021, Nilfisk has fallen short of its growth ambitions in the past.",positive
"Therefore, we spent a significant amount of time in 2021 reviewing our strategic priorities as well as the prerequisites for successful execution.",positive
We identified underutilized growth opportunities as well as how to overcome prior execution shortcomings.,positive
"Our service business, as an example, lacked the investment necessary to compete at the level of benchmarks from other industries, while our market share, in the very large-scale and growing US market, remains underrepresented.",neutral
Here we did not fully leverage our substantial local manufacturing presence and our sizable R&D competence center located in the US.,neutral
"On that basis, we have formulated a five-year business plan focused on enabling long-term sustainable growth.",positive
We are building a powerful execution engine that will translate strategic priorities into impactful implementation with clear metrics to track and commitments to ambitious sustainability targets.,positive
Over time this will create a strong execution culture and build new ways of working.,positive

This does not mean that the road ahead is going to be easy.,neutral
"The pandemic has exacted an immense economic, as well as human, cost on societies and it is inevitable that public finances will remain fragile for many years.",neutral
"Those fiscal constraints will put pressure on businesses that work closely with governments, including the pharmaceutical industry, and we will have to find new ways to ensure that our products are accessible to all those who need them.",neutral
"Beyond COVID-19, two consistent priorities were high on the BoardÕs agenda in 2020, namely scientific innovation and sustainability Ð both of which are vital to ensure the future of the company.",neutral
"It is therefore satisfying to see a healthy product pipeline, including the pioneering science that we consider to be the biggest contribution we can make to society.",neutral
Our research is now more broadly focused as we look to deliver treatments within therapy areas adjacent to our core competencies.,neutral
"Specifically, this means looking beyond semaglutide, the GLP-1 molecule found in our new oral diabetes treatment Rybelsus¨ and the once-weekly injectable Ozempic¨.",neutral
"We are exploring novel ways to treat a range of conditions beyond diabetes, including cardiovascular disease Ð the worldÕs leading cause of death1 Ð obesity and most recently also as a potential treatment for AlzheimerÕs disease.",neutral

"At Novo Nordisk, we have been focused on sustainability for many years Ð but we are determined to continue to raise our game.",neutral

The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a terrible toll around the world Ð but the pain has not been shared equally.,neutral
"People with underlying conditions have been hit disproportionately hard by the virus, a fact that makes Novo NordiskÕs purpose of driving change to defeat diabetes and other serious chronic diseases more meaningful than ever.",neutral
"Today, one in 11 people in the world has diabetes and if action is not taken to bend the curve, that figure is projected to rise to one in nine by 20451.",neutral
"The risk posed by COVID-19 to people living with diabetes and obesity is a clear wake-up call: we must continue to do more to tackle these diseases or risk vast future damage to millions of lives, as well as to broader societies and economies.",negative
We measure our contribution to the fight against diabetes and other serious chronic diseases in our Strategic Aspirations for 2025.,positive
"Appropriately, after a year as unparalleled as 2020, and as the world acknowledges the hundredth anniversary of the discovery of insulin, the first of these is 'Purpose and sustainability'.",neutral
Over the past year we have stepped up our commitment to our purpose by launching a new Defeat Diabetes social responsibility strategy.,neutral
"This sets out our ambition to accelerate the prevention of type 2 diabetes, provide access to affordable care for vulnerable patients in every country and innovate to improve lives.",neutral
"Beyond defeating serious chronic diseases, we also aspire to have zero environmental impact.",neutral
"In 2020, we took an important step by achieving our target of using 100% renewable power across global production Ð a key milestone on the road to our target of zero CO2 emissions from all operations and transport by 2030.",neutral
"We now also ask that by the end of the decade, our direct suppliers use only renewable power when supplying us.",neutral
It has been great to see some of our largest suppliers step up and meet this target already.,neutral
"Despite this encouraging progress, we can only fulfil our purpose and be respected for adding value to society if we deliver on our core contribution of scientific innovation.",neutral
"Thanks to a strategy of targeted investment, our scientists are currently pursuing higher levels of innovation across more therapy areas than at any point in the companyÕs history.",neutral
"Consequently, I believe we are now well-positioned for success in the short, medium and long term.",neutral
"Within diabetes, we are further raising the innovation bar with the roll-out of the worldÕs first once-daily GLP-1 tablet, Rybelsus¨, while at the same time working on novel insulins, 100 years after the discovery of the molecule.",neutral
"Our Research & Development (R&D) colleagues are also pursuing greater weight loss in obesity, and in 2020 they demonstrated the potential of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the STEP phase 3 clinical trial programme.",negative
"Crucially, we also broadened our technology platforms and expanded our research into adjacent disease areas in 2020 including cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and AlzheimerÕs disease Ð areas of huge unmet medical need and a great burden for patients, families and society alike.",neutral
"Our continued focus on external innovation led to the significant acquisitions of Corvidia Therapeutics and Emisphere Technologies, strengthening our positions in cutting-edge areas of cardiovascular medicine and drug delivery respectively.",neutral
"Commercially, 2020 was a challenging year as lockdowns reduced the time doctors spent with their patients, leading to fewer initiations of new treatments.",negative
"Despite this, we expanded our leadership position in the diabetes market in terms of value, keeping us on track to reach a share of more than one third by 2025.",neutral
"Diabetes sales were driven by sales of GLP-1 products (Victoza¨, Ozempic¨ and Rybelsus¨), which offset mixed market conditions for insulins.",neutral
"We continued to help more people living with obesity, while making progress with our ambition to secure sustained growth within our Biopharm division thanks to strong demand for our growth hormone and new haemophilia products.",positive
I believe that our ability to meet the needs of our millions of patients during the pandemic in 2020 comes as a consequence of our crystal-clear purpose and long-established company values.,neutral
We are far from done and have many more millions of patients for whom treatment is not accessible today.,neutral
"So now is the time to continue to invest in our people and in our organisation, creating an inclusive, diverse and safe working environment in which colleagues have equal opportunities to thrive and fulfil their potential.",neutral

Navigating through the early part of the year proved demanding with our primary markets still heavily affected by restrictions in the wake of the Corona pandemic.,neutral
"While part of our business was impacted significantly by temporary store closures and colleagues being sent home during winter and early spring Ð BR, Salling Department stores, malls, Starbucks, CarlÕs Jr. Ð other parts benefitted positively from lockdown Ð f¿tex, Bilka, Netto and online banners Ð as customer behaviour continued to change following COVID-19.",neutral
"Combined, these developments resulted in highly fluctuating sales and shifting footfall throughout the first half of the year.",neutral

"With these events defining the year, I am satisfied that Salling Group delivered a revenue of DKK 66 billion in 2021 with an EBIT of DKK 3 billion, and an EBITDA of DKK 5 billion for the first time.",positive
"On the back of the momentum gained in previous years, Salling Group continues to be well positioned for the future following a strong 2021.",positive
"I would like to extend a sincere thank you to our teams in stores, warehouses and back office functions who worked tirelessly through constant change and a severely challenged supply chain, ensuring distribution and delivering first class service to our customers every single day while keeping our strategy firmly on track.",neutral
"Even though government closure of department stores, malls, restaurants and pure nonfood stores was lifted in early spring, Salling Group chose a cautious approach to welcoming back customers and colleagues, continuing to enforce a number of voluntary and mandatory precautions to protect them from the spread of the Corona virus.",neutral
"As more than 2,000 employees who had been sent home from their regular workplaces returned to the reopened stores, they persisted in wearing face masks or visors, followed regular routines for hand sanitation and hand washing and took part in the increased cleaning procedures in all stores while a number of them were deployed as special service staff helping customers to maintain safe distancing throughout the shopping trip and comply with all safety recommendations.",neutral
"Salling Group retained safe distance markings on the shop floors, screens upholding physical distance between employees at tills and customers and separation at the end of the checkout line to ensure safety of customers when packing their goods.",neutral

For several years now Salling Group has advocated for climate labelling of food in retail and in 2021 we took the step to test climate labelling and customer climate guidance in Netto Denmark.,neutral

"Following a six month trial the test showed encouraging results as sales of climate burdensome goods such as beef, cold cuts and avocado were down between 4 and 6% while fruit and vegetable sales in general went up.",neutral

"In March 2021, Salling Group received approval from the Polish competition authorities on a deal with UK retailer Tesco to acquire 2 distribution centres and 301 stores, with formal closing of the deal conducted shortly hereafter.",neutral

"In all, 189 of the acquired stores were transformed in accordance with the modernised Netto 3.0 concept while 11 completely new Netto stores opened in Poland, adding a total of 200 stores to our discount banner.",neutral

The last Tesco store was closed in October and I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the professionalism of the former Tesco-employees in handling the transition while I thank them for their contribution as well.,neutral
The roll out continues in 2022 when Salling Group expects to add another 101 stores to the Polish Netto store portfolio.,neutral
2021 also saw Salling Group increase its presence and market share within food online in Denmark significantly with the launch of f¿tex Home Delivery and the continued expansion of Bilka ToGo through increased capacity in hyper markets and the introduction of 6 pick up stations across the country.,positive
"f¿tex Home Delivery rapidly established itself as a factor in the market, differentiating itself with a customer offer based on access to the same low, leaflet prices as in f¿texÕ physical stores, an increased online assortment, distribution by chilled delivery vans and not least service personnel from f¿tex delivering the groceries at customersÕ door step.",neutral
"At the end of the year, f¿tex Home Delivery covered Zealand with further expansion planned over the coming years.",positive
