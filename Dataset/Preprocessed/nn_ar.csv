other events go almost unnoticed in the moment but can change the way we live our lives in the future,neutral
however it is already safe to say that was totally unprece dented and everything that took place during the year will be remembered in the context of the covid pandemic,neutral
for the energy industry was without question the year of covid,neutral
the pandemic affected every part of the value chain and forced everyone to be even more resilient and innovative to ensure stable energy systems across the globe,neutral
in a year when covid dominated the agenda and challenged mobil ity as well as safety the renewable energy industryos ability to ensure continuity and sta bility was potentially game changing,neutral
it may have gone a little unnoticed but we believe the contribution made by renewables during the crisis will have huge implications for the future,negative
when the stakes were highest we showed resilience and proved we can serve as the backbone of energy systems around the world,positive
this achievement is significant because the climate crisis remains the biggest challenge the world has ever faced and questions have been raised about whether renewables are ready to replace fossil fuels to limit co emis sions,positive
to this end one positive to emerge from the covid pandemic was the clear evi dence that renewables can provide the foun dations for more resilient societies offering clean stable and cost competitive energy as well as sustaining and creating jobs,positive
as a tes tament to this governments across the globe including in the usa eu china and japan developed green recovery plans or intentions to do so in,neutral

through this acquisition we aim to build another pathway to value creation accessing the long term returns generated by renewa ble energy projects,neutral
we also aim to go beyond our development businesso current focus of co development and early stage investment in renewables projects,neutral
since we have grown revenue by percent but in that period our profitability and quality have not followed the same posi tive trajectory,neutral
although covid increased executional cost in early we made the decision to decline financial support from governments as this allows us to manage our operations and capital structure in both the short and long term,negative
the key to improving our profitability is through our own execution,neutral

vestaso vision and strategy address these challenges by setting strategic priorities and defining the best executional sequence,positive
we see this as a very directional way of enabling the whole organisation to engage in our vision to be the global leader of sustainable energy solutions,neutral
these priorities will require the integration of our onshore and offshore businesses into one efficient and winning operating model in,neutral
