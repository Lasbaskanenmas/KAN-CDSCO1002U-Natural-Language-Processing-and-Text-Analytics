# Financial Sentiment Analysis of Executive Letters

## Overview

This project applies various machine learning approaches to perform sentiment analysis on executive letters extracted from Danish annual financial reports. We benchmarked classical ML models against modern transformer-based architectures, with a special focus on FinBERT due to its domain specificity in financial text.

The models were trained on a combination of:

* Financial Phrase Bank (FPB)
* FiQA Dataset
* Custom-labeled sentences from executive letters of 20 leading Danish firms

Our results demonstrate that FinBERT delivers the highest accuracy and is most suitable for detecting nuanced sentiment in financial disclosures.

## Importance of Environment

The project requires precise environment configurations to ensure compatibility across ML libraries, especially when working with TensorFlow, Huggingface Transformers, and SpaCy pipelines.

> ⚡ **NOTE:** We recommend installing dependencies inside a Miniforge-managed environment with **Python 3.11** and **NumPy version 1.25.2**.

To avoid versioning issues, use this command:

```bash
conda create -n nlp_env python=3.11 numpy=1.25.2
```

> **Important:** Even with this environment setup, it is not guaranteed that all scripts or dependencies will function identically across all systems. Due to evolving package ecosystems and backend changes in deep learning frameworks, some files might not run as expected.
>
> Users should be aware that they may need to **upgrade to Python versions above 3.11** and transition to **NumPy version 2.x** if compatibility issues arise. This is especially relevant for the latest versions of libraries such as Transformers, TensorFlow, or Optuna, which increasingly drop support for older Python and NumPy versions.

Be prepared to adapt your environment iteratively to resolve version conflicts or deprecation warnings when replicating or extending this project.

## Technical Workflow

1. **Text Preprocessing:**

   * Tokenization, lemmatization (spaCy)
   * Contractions expansion, stopword filtering

2. **Feature Engineering:**

   * Lexicon-based scoring using Loughran-McDonald dictionary
   * TF-IDF extraction for classical models
   * Embedding-based features for transformer input

3. **Models Applied:**

   * Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
   * Multi-layer Perceptron (Keras)
   * FinBERT (Transformer)

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**

   * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   * Confusion Matrix analysis

5. **Deployment Insight:**

   * FinBERT is best suited for real-world use
   * TF-IDF + MLP shows balance between accuracy and speed
